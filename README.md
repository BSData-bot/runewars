__What's this?__

This particular repository is the datafiles required by BattleScribe to create an army list for the Runewars miniature game by Fantasy Flight.

BSData organisation created this project. It's  a GitHub group of repositories of datafiles.
Maintained by community, in no way endorsed by BattleScribe. If you want
to develop - cool! We need you! Take a look at [Getting Started wiki][]

__Okay, nice project. Is it actually working?__ _I just want those files..._

Yeah! We have it hosted on AppSpot. Take a look: [BattleScribe Data on Appspot][]

## Contributing / Reporting missing or incorrect data ##
Please do contribute. Battlescribe comes with a data editor that allows easy changes to be made to the files.

The issues tab should keep track of any noticed errors / missing data. Anyone can open an issue and report the error. The issues tab will also keep track of any *released* product that has not yet been added to the data files.
